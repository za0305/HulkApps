Purchase a Monthly Subscription.<\/p><p>With this option, you can sign up for a regular monthly subscription through the main website. Once your order has gone through, you can log into your customer account and cancel your subscription. Cancelling won't affect the box you just purchase, only future renewals. The upside of this option is that if you love your first box (which we hope you do!), you can easily log into your account and reactivate your subscription to receive more boxes.<\/p><p> 2. You can purchase yourself a Gift! With this option, you can purchase a one-time box without having to worry about an auto-renewal.
